\label{sec:crowd}

Friday July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity firm, released an update to its Falcon Sensor
software designed for Windows-based systems. The update, intending to enhance threat detection, single-handedly
disrupted the global IT infrastructure, causing widespread system crashes across various industries
(e.g., airlines, healthcare, and banking) \cite{crowdstrike2024falcon}. 

The outage costed fortune \textbf{500 companies approximately \$5.4 billion} in damages, after an 
estimated \textbf{8.5 million devices} were struck by the blue screen of death (BSoD) \cite{tidy_crowdstrike_outage_2024}\cite{kerner_crowdstrike_outage_2024}.

\section{Context and Background}
\label{sec:context}

CrowdStrike's Founder and CEO George Kurtz, addressed the public on live TV, stating ``That we're deeply sorry for the impact we've caused'' \cite{sato_crowdstrike_ceo_2024}.
Though this isn't the first time George Kurtz has been caught in the crossfire of a cybersecurity incident.
In 2010, George Kurts was the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at McAfee when they released a faulty update, also causing a BSoD.
The update, mistakenly identified a critical Windows system file (svchost.exe) as malware, causing the system to endlessly loop \cite{volenik_crowdstrike_ceo_2024}.

In a blog posted by CrowdStrike, ``as of 8:00 p.m. EDT on July 29, 2024, ~99\% of Windows sensors were back online'' \cite{crowdstrike_channel_file_291_2024}.
The incident occurred due to a bug which expected 20 input fields instead of 21, causing the software to crash. Channel File 291 was identified as the 
culprit and was removed from the software \cite{crowdstrike_channel_file_291_2024}.

\section{Modern Endpoint Security}
\label{sec:falcon}

CrowdStrike, as a cybersecurity company, offers endpoint security in the form of their Falcon solution. Falcon is a lightweight agent installed on endpoint devices to monitor and record system activity.
Securing \textbf{endpoints} means securing devices that connect to a network, such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, and thus, this is known as \textbf{endpoint security}.
90\% of successful breaches and 70\% of data breaches originate at an endpoint, costing companies millions \cite{ibm_endpoint_security}. 

Since many large scale companies have moved to the cloud, and many employees are working from home, ever more devices are connecting to sensitive data. This means many endpoint solutions 
have to constantly monitor and record system activity to detect and prevent threats. This in itself utilizes cloud-based systems to access threat intelligence, providing autonomous 
real-time protection \cite{cisco_endpoint_security}

Many original anti-viruses signature based, protecting endpoints on a device by scanning for known malware---\textbf{Indicators of Attack (IOA)}. 
This relied on a database of known malware signatures. CrowdStrike and many others
have opted to use \textbf{next-gen anti-virus (NGAV)} machine learning technology,
to aid in detecting newer types of IOA vectors that are often fileless, by monitoring system memory  \cite{ionescu_kernel_access_2024}.

\newpage

\section{EPP \& EDR Anti-virus Solutions}
\textbf{Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP)} like CrowdStrike may include the following features as defined by IBM \cite{ibm_endpoint_security}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web control and content filtering}: protects against malicious code in websites and 
    user downloaded content. While providing a whitelist of approved websites.
    \item \textbf{Data classification and data loss prevention (DLP)}: identifies and classifies sensitive data, 
    preventing unauthorized access and data loss.
    \item \textbf{Firewall}: monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on configured security rules.
    \item \textbf{Email Gateway}: scans incoming email attachments and links for malicious content.
    \item \textbf{Application control}: restricts the programs that users can run on their devices.
\end{itemize}

CrowdStrike's \textbf{Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)} solution Falcon Sensor, part of the Falcon Platform, is at the root of the issue.
EDRs are a class of security tools that go beyond known threats, to monitor files entering and applications running on a system.
These \textbf{Correlate Indicators of Compromise (IOC)} systems, aggregate data from various sources---network traffic, unusual user behavior,
inconsistent permissions, system configuration changes, unverified software or domains, repetitive file access, and more \cite{microsoft_ioc}.

These systems aren't just designed to detect threats, but respond to them while an attack is in progress. This incurs IOCs many log based solutions such as 
\textbf{extended detection and response (XDR)}, and \textbf{security information and event management (SIEM)} systems to mitigate and isolate threats, going 
as far as to shut down a system if necessary. These systems typically rely on AI to establish a baseline of normal activity and detect deviations from it \cite{microsoft_ioc}.

\section{CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor Distinctions}

The immediate reason why CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor update caused such a widespread outage was due to
the software living on at kernel level. These differ from traditional user-mode applications that crash in isolation.
Kernel-level applications are more privileged living at the heart of the operating system---if it crashes, the whole system crashes. 
This process is known as \textbf{kernel panic}, which stops the system from potentially corrupting beyond repair \cite{awati_kernel_panic}.

CrowdStrike notes three main kernel-level component features that it complies with from the Microsoft's anti-virus kernel APIs \cite{ionescu_kernel_access_2024}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kernel Patch Protection (KPP)}: also known as \textbf{PatchGuard}, prevents third-party software from modifying the Windows kernel.
    Available on 64-bit (x64) Window systems, but by-passable on 32-bit (x86) systems, CrowdStrike opts to never patch the kernel. Other 
    anti-virus choose this route, which can lead to system instability if not done correctly \cite{wikipedia_kpp}.
    \item \textbf{Kernel-Mode Code Signing (KMCS)}: CrowdStrike complies with Microsoft's KMCS requirements, which ensures that all kernel-mode code obtains a
    \textbf{Extended Validation (EV) Code Signing Certificate} from a trusted \textbf{Certificate Authority (CA)} \cite{microsoft_kmcs}\cite{reasonlabs_kernel_hooking}.
    \item \textbf{Object Callbacks:} a feature that allows CrowdStrike to subscribe to various kernel events, such as file creation, registry access, and network activity.
    Instead of \textbf{kernel hooking}, which intercepts system calls \cite{microsoft_obregistercallbacks}.
\end{itemize}

CrowdStrike further justifies its kernel presence to protect against for \textbf{Early Boot Protection (EBP)} and which 
Microsoft supports with its \textbf{Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM)} driver \cite{ionescu_kernel_access_2024}. This protects against rootkits, which are 
malware that can hide from the operating system, by loading before the operating system itself. Having this 
protection in place, stops attackers from sticking USBs into airport kiosks or hotel computers \cite{baker_rootkits_2023}.

\section{Faulty Code and Production Updates:}

Despite CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor passing \textbf{Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP)} certifications, and 
validations through \textbf{Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK)} testing, the update still slipped through \cite{microsoftwhcpcertification}.
However, anti-virus software only needs to pass the WHCP and HLK tests once. They only certify that the driver running on the system 
is stable. Once the driver is installed, CrowdStrike can push updates---\textbf{without re-certification}---in a cloud-based process they call 
\textbf{Rapid Response Content (RRC)} \cite{crowdstrikechannelfile291rca}.

This process entirely relies on CrowdStrike's internal deploy and testing pipelines. CrowdStrike's testing negligence, did not thoroughly test the update,
during their RRC update to its Falcon Sensor software. Typically a software companies employ \textbf{Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)} pipelines
to catch these issues. CI/CD pipelines are characterized by multiple rounds of manual written tests, peer reviewed code, and automated stress testing to ensure the software compiles safely before deployment \cite{redhat_cicd_2023}.
These tests comprise of \textbf{unit tests}, \textbf{integration tests}, and \textbf{end-to-end (E2E) tests} to ensure the software is functioning as expected. 
Unit tests test individual components of the software, integration tests test how the components interact, and E2E, running the application in production-like environments (e.g., test and development environments before production) in 
a suite of integration tests to ensure stability. CrowdStrike lacked the CI/CD security to catch Channel File 291, a bug that effectively threw an out-of-bounds error.

\section{CrowdStrike Incident Report}

Before jumping into CrowdStrike's incident analysis, we must first understand the technical terms used in the analysis \cite{crowdstrikechannelfile291rca}:

\begin{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{Falcon OverWatch\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and Falcon Complete\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}}: OverWatch is a 24/7 managed threat hunting service led by human 
     intelligence. Complete is a \textbf{managed detection and response (MDR)} service, which is a suite of tools and services including OverWatch, to detect and remediate threats
     \cite{cosive_falcon_complete}\cite{crowdstrike_falcon_complete}\cite{crowdstrike_overwatch}.
     
     \item \textbf{Security Telemetry \& Graph Store}: Telemetry is the aggregation of data from various sources (e.g., endpoints, servers, network devices) \cite{proofpoint_telemetry}. These analytics are
     are stored locally on the Falcon Sensor's sensors in a graph database. Graph databases store information in nodes and edges to represent 
     the relationship between data points \cite{oracle_graph_database}.

     \newpage
     Falcon Sensor's interprets relationships in flowing memory to detect possible IOAs.\\
     \begin{figure}[h!]
        \vspace{-1em}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Sections/crowd/graph.png}
        \caption{Graph Example Depicting Relationships Between Co-workers}
        \label{fig:graphdb}
        
        \vspace{-1em}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item \textbf{Template Types}: Template types push telemetry data to a regular-expression (RegEx) engine
    Content Interpreter. Template types outline predefined schemas of security criteria to evaluate. \textbf{Template Instances}
    are live configurations, defining parameters, thresholds, and conditions to trigger alerts.
    \item \textbf{Channel Files}: Each Falcon sensor defines a channel file, which is configured with a 
    template type. RRCs then push threat intelligence to channel files. Template instances then compare the security telemetry to 
    determine IOAs.

   
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{Sections/crowd/rrc.png}
        \caption{RRC \& Telemetry Graph Store Data Aggregation for IOA Content Interpreter.}
        \label{fig:channelfile}
    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-1em}
February 2024, CrowdStrike released sensor version 7.11, introducing a new template type.
The template type target a new IOA vector relating to \textbf{Windows Interprocess Communication (IPC)} mechanisms---notably \textbf{Named Pipes}.
Named pipes facilitate communication between processes on the same or different machines.
The exploit enabled an adversary to execute code and impersonation leading to privilege escalation \cite{sandker_named_pipes_2021}.

This release included a new IPC template type. RRC delivers IPC template instances to \textbf{Channel File 291}. This 
new template type defined 21 input fields, while the Content Interpreter still expected 20. This evaded detection 
as the Content Interpreter identified files based on a wildcard matching pattern.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Wildcard Pattern Matching Example]
    *: Matches any sequence 
    ?: Matches any single character
    Input: txt = ``abcdef'', pattern = ``a?c*''
    Output: true
    Reason: `?' matches with `b' and `*' matches with ``def''.
\end{lstlisting}
    
\noindent
(As CrowdStrike has mentioned their use of RegEx before, it is likely that the Content Interpreter used a RegEx pattern to match fields.)

On July 19, 2024, the RRC push two new IPC template instances to Channel---one of which dropped wildcard matching.
This required the Content Interpreter to check the 21st field from Channel File 291. However, the Content Interpreter
expected 20 fields, causing an out-of-bounds error, crashing the Falcon Sensor. This error 
caused the BSoD that Friday afternoon affecting 8.5 million devices.

\section{Windows Kernel Crash Dump Analysis}

David Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft, \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/07/27/windows-security-best-practices-for-integrating-and-managing-security-tools/}{posted} in an incident
the kernel crash dump from Channel File 291 \cite{weston_windows_security_2024}. The Microsoft team's \textbf{Windows Error Reporting (WER)}
kernel crash dumps analysis involved \textbf{WinDBG Kernel Debugger}, and several other freely accessible debugging extensions.

Upon inspecting csagent.sys, we verify that csagent.sys is a \textbf{File System Filter Driver (FLT)} (line 18-19).
FLT drivers are often used by anti-virus software to receive file system event notifications.
This also verifies CrowdStrike usage of object callbacks to subscribe to kernel events. Additionally
the FLT API provides support for IPC monitoring, which aligns with CrowdStrike's new template type.

Line 23 (modified to fit page) shows the full file path of Channel File 291, confirming the cause of the crash.
The dump shows the crash is due to an out-of-bounds error.
While the crash dump is not publicly available, the Microsoft team confirms the out-of-bounds error in the given crash dump.
Microsoft confirmed the crash to be Crowdstrike's fault early on into the incident due to there being no public facing crash message, only a BSoD, which led to some to believe Microsoft was at fault.

Despite the fact that this is not Kurtz's first significant security mishap, it would be unfair to place responsibility squarely on his shoulders: 
each Windows sensor release is certified through extensive testing in Microsoft's HLK and WHQL.
The lack of comprehensive end-to-end testing introduced a critical error that was not caught by their CI pipelines. Such an erroneous
mistake could have been easily caught in a test or development environments, raising substantial concerns. 
The 12 page incident report duly noted this, mentioning under point 5 of the Findings and mitigations section that CrowdStrike should 
"expand [validation] to include testing within the Content Interpreter" \cite{crowdstrikechannelfile291rca}.
Even though customers managed to recover from the incident, but CrowdStrike continues to face severe legal repercussions.
